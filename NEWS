Version 0.5.1 of open source Team Foundation for Mono is now available at
http://code.google.com/p/tf4mono/

This is a development update with win32 installation packages, a GTK-based gui mode 
for exploring TFS repositories, command enhancements, improved builtin help with
usage guidelines, and many bugfixes.

If you're not familiar with Microsoft's Team Foundation / Team System product,
checkout the section "What is Team Foundation / Team System?" below.

Example invocations of the tf4mono client can be found here:
  http://tf4mono.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/examples/


Enhancements include:
===================================================================
# Add "explore" command for visually browsing a repository. Features include
syntax highlighting, sortable columns, multiple views, and copy-and-paste for code review
feedback. This is a work in progress!

# Win32 packages of tf4mono, built with NSIS. A base version without GTK dependencies 
and no explore command and a full version WITH GTK dependencies and the "explore" command
are available.

# Add gtk login dialog for missing auth credentials

# Undo with no args will undo all local changes, previously the command
required at least one filename or path

# All commands now support reading arguments from stdin

# Command chaining now supports output piping using %%. Implemented for ls-files 
and diff /q commands only! For example, you can say "tf ls-files /others %% add"
to add all unknown files to the repository. 

# Support wildcards in checkout paths

# Teach tf workspaces command to filter by workspace name if requested

# Add syntax guidance to tf help <cmd> invocations

# 8 more test cases for tf client program covering add, renaming, 
and deleting of directories, and renaming files

# Report on UndonePendingChange events (which can happen if file upload
	fails on checkin for example)


Bugfixes include:
===================================================================
# BUGFIX: tf rename <olddir> <newdir> should work now
# BUGFIX: teach diff /modified to check file hashes before reporting a modified file
# BUGFIX: when told to delete a directory, delete files within them too
# BUGFIX: implement CheckAuthentication call - this makes adding large numbers
	of files more reliable as it prevents NTML authentication timeout related failures
# BUGFIX: on windows, must do case insensitive path comparisons 
	when looking for cached workspace info
# BUGFIX: tf online <list-of-files> didn't pickup deletes to pend
# BUGFIX: GetLocalWorkspaceInfo(string path) should trim workspaceinfo directory
	separators before looking for a match
# BUGFIX: TryGetServerItemForLocalItem and TryGetLocalItemForServerItem
	should find longest match
# BUGFIX: teach tf workfold /unmap to accept relative paths
# BUGFIX: always sort items in an ItemSet (sorts tf dir output for example)


What is Team Foundation / Team System?
===================================================================
Team Foundation is a 'collection of collaborative technologies that
support a team effort to deliver a product' from Microsoft that 
includes bug tracking, source control, and other capabilities.'

Team Foundation powers Microsoft's CodePlex site and is used in many 
corporate environments. 

Team Foundation for Mono provides the TF client for accessing 
Team Foundation Servers as well as the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.* 
assemblies related to Version Control. 

An example of accessing CodePlex to pull the latest version of 
the "Turtle" project is below.


CodePlex Example Usage
===================================================================
In the commands below,
   UID = your codeplex user name
   PWD = your codeplex password
   MACHINENAME = your machine name (or any other random name)

First create a workspace:

tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD 
workspace /new "MACHINENAME;UID"

Then map "Turtle" project to a local folder:

tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD 
workfold "$/Turtle" ~/Source/turtle

Then pull the files:

tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD get 
~/Source/turtle /recursive

Then you could review the history, review a changeset, then look
at the diff of the changeset. Note: the examples below assume
the tf client "Credentials.Save" option was enabled.

cd ~/Source/turtle
tf history /recursive .
tf changeset 340
tf diff C340


Source and Packages
===================================================================
Debian packages, Win32 packages, and source tarball available here:
   http://code.google.com/p/tf4mono/downloads/list

Additionally, a git clone of the source tree can be made with:

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/tfs.git

This is where most development happens.

SVN users can check out the semi-regularly updated project source code at:

    svn checkout http://tf4mono.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tf4mono


Project Site
===================================================================
There is a Google Code Project Site for tf4mono, the URL is:

There is a Google Discussion Group for tf4mono as well. The URL is:
