Version 0.6 of open source Team Foundation for Mono is now available at
http://code.google.com/p/opentf/. 

This is a development update with a new IRC changeset notification bot,
support for CruiseControl (an open source continuous build framework),
a monodevelop plugin for browsing TFS servers, several new commands 
("shelve", "rollback", and "merges"), numerous API and usability enhancements, 
and many bugfixes.

A detailed changelog can be found below.

To learn more about many of the unique features found in OpenTF see:

Enhancements include:
===================================================================

# CRUISECONTROL: add support for date range queries to the history
	command, e.g. -version:"D2006-10-01T01:01:01Z~D2006-12-13T20:00:00Z"
# CRUISECONTROL: add -noprompt option
# CRUISECONTROL: add support for username@domain -login syntax
# TFSBOT: add new IRC commit notification daemon. 

# add alpha-quality MonoDevelop addin, with debian package
# implement "tf shelve <name> <path>" to create new shelvesets
# implement "tf shelve /delete <name>" for deleting shelvesets
# implement "tf merges <src> <dest>" for listing merge points
# implement "tf diff /ignorespace" option
# implement "tf rollback <changeset>" for undoing a changeset.
	NOTE: only useful if no one else has changed the file since then.

# add Get.ChangesetMtimes setting: By enabling this option, 
	the TF will set the modification time of any file subsequently fetched
	to the date of the last changeset in which the file was modified. 
	Warning: this mode of operation can significantly slow down "tf get".

# add Get.DefaultToCwd setting: By enabling this option, the TF 
	client will look for updates starting with the current working folder 
	instead of pulling updates from all registered working folders.

# add Workspace.Default setting: If the TF client cannot determine the 
	active workspace, first from the "/workspace:" option, and second the 
	workspace cache, then it will use the Workspace.Default setting if non-null.


API Enhancements
==================================================================

# Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common: Artifact, ArtifactId, ILinking

What is Team Foundation / Team System?
===================================================================
Team Foundation is a 'collection of collaborative technologies that
support a team effort to deliver a product' from Microsoft that 
includes bug tracking, source control, and other capabilities.'

Team Foundation powers Microsoft's CodePlex site and is used in many 
corporate environments. 

Team Foundation for Mono provides the TF client for accessing 
Team Foundation Servers as well as the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.* 
assemblies related to Version Control. 

An example of accessing CodePlex to pull the latest version of 
the "Turtle" project is below.


CodePlex Example Usage
===================================================================
In the commands below,
   UID = your codeplex user name
   PWD = your codeplex password
   MACHINENAME = your machine name (or any other random name)

First create a workspace:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD 
  workspace /new "MACHINENAME;UID"

Then map the "Turtle" project to a local folder:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD 
  workfold "$/Turtle" ~/Source/turtle

Then pull the files:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD get 
  ~/Source/turtle /recursive

Then you could review the history, review a changeset, then look
at the diff of the changeset. Note: the examples below assume
the tf client "Credentials.Save" option was enabled.

  cd ~/Source/turtle
  tf history /recursive .
  tf changeset 340
  tf diff C340

More examples can be found in the docs/examples/ folder.


Source and Packages
===================================================================
Deb packages, Win32 packages, RPM packages, and source tarball available here:
   http://code.google.com/p/opentf/downloads/list

Additionally, a git clone of the source tree can be made with:

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/tfs.git

This is where most development happens.

SVN users can check out the semi-regularly updated project source code at:

    svn checkout http://opentf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ opentf
