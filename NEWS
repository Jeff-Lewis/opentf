What is Team Foundation / Team System?
===================================================================
Team Foundation is a 'collection of collaborative technologies that
support a team effort to deliver a product' from Microsoft that 
includes bug tracking, source control, and other capabilities.'

Team Foundation powers Microsoft's CodePlex site and is used in many 
corporate environments. 

Team Foundation for Mono provides the TF client for accessing 
Team Foundation Servers as well as the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.* 
assemblies related to Version Control. 

An example of accessing CodePlex to pull the latest version of 
the "Turtle" project is below.


CodePlex Example Usage
===================================================================
In the commands below,
   UID = your codeplex user name
   PWD = your codeplex password
   MACHINENAME = your machine name (or any other random name)

First create a workspace:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD 
  workspace /new "MACHINENAME;UID"

Then map the "Turtle" project to a local folder:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD 
  workfold "$/Turtle" ~/Source/turtle

Then pull the files:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD get 
  ~/Source/turtle /recursive

Then you could review the history, review a changeset, then look
at the diff of the changeset. Note: the examples below assume
the tf client "Credentials.Save" option was enabled.

  cd ~/Source/turtle
  tf history /recursive .
  tf changeset 340
  tf diff C340

More examples can be found in the docs/examples/ folder.


Source and Packages
===================================================================
Deb packages, Win32 packages, RPM packages, and source tarball available here:
   http://code.google.com/p/opentf/downloads/list

Additionally, a git clone of the source tree can be made with:

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/tfs.git

This is where most development happens.

SVN users can check out the semi-regularly updated project source code at:

    svn checkout http://opentf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ opentf
