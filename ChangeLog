	* v0.6.0 release notes

	# CRUISECONTROL: add support for date range queries to the history
	command, e.g. -version:"D2006-10-01T01:01:01Z~D2006-12-13T20:00:00Z"
	# CRUISECONTROL: add -noprompt option
	# CRUISECONTROL: add support for username@domain -login syntax
	# TFSBOT: add new IRC commit notification daemon. 
	# NEW: add alpha-quality MonoDevelop addin, with debian package
	# NEW: implement "tf shelve <name> <path>" to create new shelvesets

	# NEW: add Get.ChangesetMtimes setting: By enabling this option, 
	the TF will set the modification time of any file subsequently fetched
	to the date of the last changeset in which the file was modified. 
	Warning: this mode of operation can significantly slow down "tf get".
	NOTE: Is this the best we can do? Does the server have any better datetime info?
	# NEW: add Get.DefaultToCwd setting: By enabling this option, the TF 
	client will look for updates starting with the current working folder 
	instead of pulling updates from all registered working folders.
	# NEW: add Workspace.Default setting: If the TF client cannot determine the 
	active workspace, first from the "/workspace:" option, and second the 
	workspace cache, then it will use the Workspace.Default setting if non-null.

	# Implement label and unlabel commands
	# Add "cache" command which shows workspace cache settings
	# Add /added, /modified, /deleted flags to Online command to
	show just additions, just modifications, or just deletions 
	respectively. These flags may be combined. With no flags, all
	changes are incorporated.

	unified diff. Can be used to review changes before using the online
	command.
	# Add File.Excludes config option. Use in "online" command.

	standard MS client.
	# Add tf ls-files /writable option (mainly for windows users)
	# BUGFIX: Fixed multiple issues related to running opentf on windows.
	these include deleting read-only files and deleting files still open,
	which succeed on *nix platforms, but not on windows.
	# BUGFIX: Online command on windows. Replace server item path separator 
	with platform path separator.
	# BUGFIX: Replace windows path separators in diff headers with nix path 
	separator so /usr/bin/patch is happy

	# BUGFIX: Compare file hashes when looking for modifications in tf online 
	command. Previously just looked for files marked writable.

	* v0.4.4 release notes:
	
	NOTE: in this release VersionControl.config is now stored in ~/.tf/Cache/,
	instead of ~/.tf/ - this change was made for consistency with the 
	MS versions of the TFS assemblies. If you've used the TF tool previously,
	just move VersionControl.config from ~/.tf/ to ~/.tf/Cache/
	
	# add basic version of TF Power Tool 1.1 "online" command to tf.exe,
	  includes /preview mode.
	# add basic version of TF Power Tool 1.2 "treeclean" command to tf.exe,
	  includes /preview mode.

	  on a single command line, please see documentation for usage

	# add basic "help" command
	# add config command with options "Checkin.Validate", "Credentials.Save",
	  and "History.Recursive"
	
	# read server setings from cache file, don't need /server 
	  quite as much now
	# load/store credentials from gnome-keyring if available, prompt for
	  password when not supplied.
	
	# undoing a delete restores the file now
	# numerous API additions including: WorkspaceVersionSpec, IDiffItem, 
	  DiffItemVersionedFile, DiffOutputType, DiffOptionFlags, DiffOptions, 
	  Conflict*, ExceptionEvent* types
	# add DisplayString property for all VersionSpec classes and test cases
	# better man page
	# better error messages

	online commands on windows, and use Path.DirectorySeparatorChar
	# BUGFIX: GetLocalWorkspaceInfo should find longest matching path,
	not first matching path
	# BUGFIX: tf get should use CWD only to find workspace
	# BUGFIX: properly handle checkin of files marked read-only

2007-04-22  Joel Reed  <joelwreed@gmail.com>

	* v0.4.2 release: add support for querying ExtendedItems. Implement
	tf.exe property command which uses ExtendedItems. Add GettingEventHandler,
	PendingChangeEventHandler, ProcessingChangeEventHandler, 
	and OperationStatus.

	tf.exe now compiles/runs on MS CLR. Many bug fixes were made to APIs,
	and client utility while testing on Windows.

	tf.exe supports two new commands: "ls-files" and "properties".
	The "status" command output was cleaned up. 

	Added debian packages via "make dist"
	
	Started MonoDevelop plugin based on Subversion plugin. Work in progress.
	Lots of code cleanups and bug fixes.

	history, and checkin commands. added file permissions handling
	using libmagic. show changeset id from server. doc updates.
	multiple API additions and bug fixes.
	
2007-03-10 joel reed  <joelwreed@gmail.com>

	* v0.3 release: much better support for tracking a repository,
	including new files, deleted files, and renames. A preliminary
	man page has been added, and utility commands like add, delete, 
	checkout, and rename now modify the state of the server. The 
	checkin command has a mysterious bug which prevents these 
	modifications from being added back to the repository, 
	but that should be cleaned up soon.

2006-12-29 joel reed  <joelwreed@gmail.com>

	* v0.1 release: dir, labels, workspaces, view,
	and permissions commands have initial implementations
