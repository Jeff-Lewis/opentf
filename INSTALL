Gnome Keyring Support
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The command line client, tf, has optional support for storing 
login credentials in the Gnome Keyring. 

SUSE seems to have a patched Gnome Keyring that installs the assembly
into the GAC, most other distros have not yet picked up this
change. If you're running such a distro, you need to execute the
following command:

  cp /usr/lib/Gnome.Keyring/Gnome.Keyring.dll $PREFIX/lib/teamfoundation/

where $PREFIX is the prefix you supplied to the configure script above.
