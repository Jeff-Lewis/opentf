#summary Configuration required to run the unit tests

Most of the unit tests require a working TeamFoundation server. Currently, the unit
tests use the following environment variables to configure which server, user account, 
password, project, etc. to use for testing purposes.

export TFS_URL=<url to server, eg. http://192.168.0.1:8080/>;

export TFS_USERNAME=<your-username>; 

export TFS_DOMAIN=<your-domain>; 

export TFS_PASSWORD=<your-password>; 

export TFS_PROJECT=<a top-level project name, eg. MyProject>;

then you can do a "make run-tests"
