Team Foundation is a "collection of collaborative technologies that 
support a team effort to deliver a product." It includes bug tracking, 
source control, and other features (*).

For example, Microsoft's CodePlex site (http://codeplex.com/) 
uses a Team Foundation Server for the source control backend.

For instructions on how to build and install this software, 
see the file INSTALL.


Namespaces under Development
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  Microsoft.TeamFoundation
  Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common
  Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client
  Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client 
  Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Common


The TF tool
-----------------------------------------------------------------

An in progress implementation of the Team Foundation client, tf.exe,
can be found in tools/tf/. If found, it will make use of libmagic 
to compute file permissions, as TF servers do not track/store
permissions.

Documentation on the tool can be found on msdn at:
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/cc31bk2e(VS.80).aspx

Supported Informational Commands:
  dir, get, labels, status, view, workfold, workspace, workspaces,
	history, properties, ls-files, permissions

You can now track a repository using the 
following commands:

  tf /server:<server-ip> /login:<domain>\\<username>,<password> workspace /new "<workspace name>;<username>";
  tf /server:<server-ip> /login:<domain>\\<username>,<password> workfold "$/<project name>" /usr/local/src/somedir

Then as often as you like run:
  tf /server:<server-ip> /login:<domain>\\<username>,<password> /recursive get /usr/local/src/somedir /workspace:someworkspace

Supported Utility Commands:
  add, checkin, edit/checkout, delete, get, undo, rename

  These utility commands will modify the state of the server, but checkin
  has a bug which prevents the changes being completed. undo can be used to
  revert add/delete/edit type changes on the server.


Running the Unit Tests
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the unit tests require a working TeamFoundation server. Currently, the unit
tests use the following environment variables to configure which server, user account, 
password, project, etc. to use for testing purposes.

export TFS_URL=<url to server, eg. http://192.168.0.1:8080/>;
export TFS_USERNAME=<your-username>; 
export TFS_DOMAIN=<your-domain>; 
export TFS_PASSWORD=<your-password>; 
export TFS_PROJECT=<a top-level project name, eg. MyProject>;

CodePlex Example Usage
===================================================================
For registered developers, CodePlex is a publicly accessible example
of a Team Foundation server used to host open source projects. Here's
some examples of how to use the TF tool to access CodePlex hosted 
source code.

In the commands below,

  UID = your codeplex user name
  PWD = your codeplex password
  MACHINENAME = your machine name (or any other random name)

Note:	"snd" is the domain name I got with my signon. Not sure
if this is the same for everyone or not.

First create a workspace:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD
  workspace /new "MACHINENAME;UID"

Then map "Turtle" project to a local folder:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD
  workfold "$/Turtle" ~/Source/turtle

Then pull the files:

  tf /server:https://tfs01.codeplex.com /login:snd\\UID,PWD get
  ~/Source/turtle /recursive

Now, to edit the "License.txt" file:

  cd ~/Source/turtle
  tf edit License.txt

This makes the file writable. To see what you have checked out:

  tf status

To check License.txt back in:

	tf checkin /comment:"My comment" License.txt

This makes the file read-only again. You don't have to specify
License.txt. If you don't specify a filename or filenames, it checks
in everything you have checked out.

Then you could review the history, review a changeset, then look
at the diff of the changeset. Note: the examples below assume
Credentials.Save is on.

  cd ~/Source/turtle
  tf history /recursive .
  tf changeset 340
  tf diff C340


Code Samples
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Buck Hodges has written numerous examples of using the TFS API.
You can find a list of these samples here:

The following examples have been compiled and tested against
TF for Mono:
