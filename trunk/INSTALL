Building Opentf on Win32
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, you can either use the opentf.sln soluion file and build 
Opentf with VS2005 or VS2008, or install cygwin and follow the 
instructions below for building opentf on *nix.

If you build with VS2005 or VS2008, the resulting opentf.exe TF client
will end up in tools/opentf/bin/.


Building Opentf on *Nix
-----------------------------------------------------------------

First, configure opentf:

	./configure [--prefix=/yourprefix]

Valid options include:

    --disable-gtk           disable gtk gui support
    --enable-highlight      enable syntax highlighting support
    --disable-keyring       disable gnome keyring support
    --disable-magic         disable libmagic file attributes

To build:

	make

To install:

	make install


Gnome Keyring Support on *Nix
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The command line client, tf, has optional support for storing 
login credentials in the Gnome Keyring. 

SUSE seems to have a patched Gnome Keyring that installs the assembly
into the GAC, most other distros have not yet picked up this
change. If you're running such a distro, you need to execute the
following command:

  cp /usr/lib/Gnome.Keyring/Gnome.Keyring.dll $PREFIX/lib/opentf/

where $PREFIX is the prefix you supplied to the configure script above.
