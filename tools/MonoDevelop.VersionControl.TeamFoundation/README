MonoDevelop VersionControl Api Suggestions

It would be nice if SelectRepositoryDialog.cs checked a CanCheckout 
property on the Repository. For TeamFoundation, I have a base Repository
is really the server, which has Children which are the top level projects
in that Repository.

The UrlBasedRepositoryEditor doesn't seem to let you enter ports over 100.
You need to use port 8080 for most TFS Servers. You may need to edit 
~/.config/MonoDevelop/VersionControl.config by hand.
